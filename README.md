# Heart Disease Classification

This repository contains the coursework for the Heart Disease Classification project, which aims to explore machine learning algorithms for the classification of heart disease cases. The project focuses on the implementation and evaluation of four machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.

## Repository Structure

- `code/`: Contains Python code for implementing the machine learning models and conducting experiments.
- `dataset/`: Includes the Heart Disease dataset used in the coursework.
- `README.md`: The README file providing an overview of the coursework.

## Running the Code

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Upload the Heart Disease dataset file (`heart_disease_data.csv`) to your preferred environment.
3. Update the `data_path` variable in the code files to reflect the correct dataset path.
4. Open the code files in your chosen environment and execute the code cells to run the experiments.

Note: The code in this coursework was developed and tested in Python using Google Colab Notebook, but it can be adapted to other environments as needed for optimal execution.
